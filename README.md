## Description
This repository is dedicated to low-level programming, covering topics like memory management, data structures, algorithms, and basic system calls in C. Each directory in this repository contains specific tasks related to different concepts learned in the course.

The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of how programs work under the hood, how the system allocates memory, and how to write efficient code.

## Projects
Some of the topics and projects covered in this repository include:

- **Hello, World**: Basic syntax of C, compiling, and printing output.
- **Variables, if, else, while**: Control structures and loops in C.
- **Functions and Nested Loops**: Writing functions and understanding loop nesting.

Each project folder contains its own `README.md` with more details on the specific tasks and code samples.

## Requirements
- **Compiler**: `gcc` with options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- **Languages**: C programming language

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/holbertonschool-low_level_programming.git
2. Navigate to a project directory:
   ```bash
   cd hello_world
3. Compile and run the programs:
   ```bash
   gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 <file_name.c> -o <output_name>
   ./<output_name>
