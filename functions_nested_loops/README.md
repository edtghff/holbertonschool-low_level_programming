## Tasks
Some of the key tasks included in this project are:
- Implementing functions that perform various operations
- Creating nested loops for patterns and other repetitive tasks.
- Solving specific problems using functions and nested loops.

Each task is detailed in its own file and is accompanied by comments explaining the code.

## Requirements
- **Compiler**: `gcc` with options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- **Languages**: C programming language

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/edtghff/functions_nested_loops.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd functions_nested_loops
3. Compile the functions:
   ```bash
   gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 <file_name.c> -o <output_name>
4. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./<output_name>
